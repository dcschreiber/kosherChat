This project was created as programming exercise.
It can be used under the license that lets you use it however you like.

The data need to be imported using https://github.com/dcschreiber/kosherklbdcleaning
I used Mongo for local env and firestore with Algolia on production.
You will see, these DBs are very coupled to the project.

You will also have to set up the Whatsapp API.
